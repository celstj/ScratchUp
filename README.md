   - task list created from (+) sign
   - dynamically name change on creation, on task location
   - if not, (pop up input)
        - rename on doubleclick/rightclick/enter (?)

Each task list
    - title
    - description
    - due date
    - priority
 ! - notes

1. view all projects on sidepanel
2. view all todos in each project (title, duedate, colours via priority) ((dropdown))
3. expand a single todo to see/edit details
4. delete a todo
5. !! localStoage 


To implement later:
  - optimise main UI: show/toggle projectName MAIN DIV when clicked on nav
    instead of the main page being existing with use of display: none/block
  - switch from browser storage to local storage or cloud
  - implement user login and authentication
